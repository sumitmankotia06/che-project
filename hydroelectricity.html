                <div><ul class="advantages-list">
                    <li><strong>Renewable Resource:</strong> Hydroelectric power is renewable, meaning it can be replenished naturally and doesn't deplete over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Emissions:</strong> It produces little to no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making it a clean energy source.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Efficiency:</strong> Hydroelectric power plants are very efficient, converting a high percentage of the energy in water into usable electricity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Hydroelectric dams can store energy, releasing it when demand is high, thus providing grid stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flood Control and Irrigation:</strong> Dams provide additional benefits like flood control and irrigation for nearby agricultural areas.</li>

                <div><ul class="disadvantages-list">
                    <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Dams can disrupt local ecosystems, affecting fish migration and water quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Initial Cost:</strong> The construction of hydroelectric plants, particularly dams, is expensive and time-consuming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependence on Water Availability:</strong> Hydroelectric power is dependent on water levels, so regions experiencing droughts or seasonal fluctuations may face reduced energy production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Displacement of Communities:</strong> Large dams often require the displacement of local communities, disrupting their way of life.</li>

            <h2>Applications of Hydroelectric Energy</h2>
            <p>Hydroelectric energy has a variety of uses, including:</p>
            <ul class="applications-list">
                <li><strong>Electricity Generation:</strong> The primary application of hydroelectric energy is the generation of electricity, both for local use and for distribution to national grids.</li>
                <li><strong>Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity:</strong> Used to store energy for future use by pumping water to a higher elevation during periods of low electricity demand, then releasing it to generate power during high demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Flood Control:</strong> Hydroelectric dams help control floods by regulating water flow, especially in areas with heavy rainfall or snowmelt.</li>
                <li><strong>Recreation:</strong> Many reservoirs created by hydroelectric dams offer opportunities for water-based recreation such as boating and fishing.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="future" class="section">
            <h2>Future of Hydroelectric Energy</h2>
            <img src="https://www.tariff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-future-of-hydropower.jpg" alt="Future of Hydroelectric Energy" class="image">
            <p>The future of hydroelectric energy includes expanding the use of small-scale hydroelectric plants, known as "micro-hydro," which can be used 
                for local power generation. Advances in technology will help mitigate the environmental impact of large dams,
                 and improvements in turbine efficiency could increase the output of existing hydroelectric plants. 
                 Furthermore, hydroelectricity could play a key role in energy storage, helping to balance the 
                 variability of other renewable sources like wind and solar power.</p>
