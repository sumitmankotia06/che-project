                <div><p>Marine energy refers to the energy derived from the movement of water, specifically from the tides and waves in the ocean. 
                    <br>It is a form of renewable energy that has the potential to provide a significant amount of clean power. 
                    <br>Marine energy can be harnessed through technologies such as tidal turbines and wave energy converters,
                    offering an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels.</p></div>

                <div><img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tidal-Energy.jpg" alt="Tidal Energy" class="image"></div>
                <div><p>Tidal energy utilizes the rise and fall of ocean tides to generate power. 
                    <br>The movement of water is captured using turbines that are placed in tidal streams or estuaries. 
                    <br>The gravitational forces of the moon and the sun cause the tides to ebb and flow, 
                    <br>making tidal energy a predictable and reliable form of renewable energy. 
                    <br>It can be harnessed using technologies like tidal barrage systems and underwater turbines.</p></div>

                <div><img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wave-Energy.jpg" alt="Wave Energy" class="image"></div>
                <div><p>Wave energy is generated from the surface motion of ocean waves. 
                    <br>Unlike tidal energy, which is driven by gravitational forces, wave energy is created by the wind blowing over the surface of the sea. 
                    <br>Specialized devices such as oscillating water columns, point absorbers, and attenuators are used to capture the movement of waves and convert it into electricity. 
                    <br>Wave energy is abundant, but it is less predictable than tidal energy.</p></div>

            <ul class="advantages-list">
                <li><strong>Renewable and Sustainable:</strong> Both tidal and wave energy are renewable sources of energy, with little to no emissions during operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Tidal energy is highly predictable due to the consistent and regular nature of tides. Wave energy is less predictable but still reliable in many regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Land Use:</strong> Marine energy systems typically have minimal land use, with most infrastructure placed offshore.</li>
                <li><strong>High Energy Potential:</strong> Oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface, offering vast potential for energy generation from tides and waves.</li>

            <ul class="disadvantages-list">
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> The construction of marine energy systems can disrupt marine ecosystems, affecting wildlife and fisheries.</li>
                <li><strong>High Costs:</strong> The initial investment for setting up marine energy infrastructure is high due to the harsh offshore conditions and technological requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance Challenges:</strong> Marine energy systems are exposed to harsh ocean conditions, making maintenance and durability a concern.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Locations:</strong> Marine energy systems are best suited to specific locations with suitable tidal and wave conditions, limiting their widespread applicability.</li>
