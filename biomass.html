                <div><p style="font-size: 20px;">Biomass energy is derived from organic materials, such as plants, agricultural waste, and animal waste.
                    These materials are used to produce energy in the form of electricity, heat, or biofuels. 
                    Biomass can be converted into energy through processes like burning, fermentation, and conversion to gas or liquids.</p></div>

                <div><ul class="advantages-list">
                    <li><strong>Renewable Resource:</strong> Biomass is a renewable source of energy, as long as the resources are managed sustainably. It can be replenished through plant growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduces Waste:</strong> Biomass energy can help reduce waste by using organic material that would otherwise end up in landfills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Neutral:</strong> Biomass is considered carbon-neutral because the carbon dioxide released during combustion is offset by the carbon absorbed by the plants during their growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Security:</strong> Biomass can provide energy independence, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to national energy security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supports Agriculture:</strong> Biomass energy supports the agricultural sector by providing new markets for crops and organic waste products.</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages of Biomass Energy</h2>
            <ul class="disadvantages-list">
                <li><strong>Land Use:</strong> Large-scale biomass production requires significant land, which could otherwise be used for food production or natural ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> The burning of biomass can release particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants that may impact air quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation Risk:</strong> If not managed sustainably, biomass production could lead to deforestation, negatively impacting biodiversity and contributing to climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>High Costs:</strong> The initial investment for setting up biomass power plants and fuel production facilities can be high, making it less competitive compared to fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Issues:</strong> Biomass energy systems can be less efficient than other forms of energy, especially when considering transportation and processing costs of raw materials.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="applications" class="section">
            <h2>Applications of Biomass Energy</h2>
            <p>Biomass energy has a wide range of applications, including:</p>
            <ul class="applications-list">
                <li><strong>Electricity Generation:</strong> Biomass is used in power plants to generate electricity by burning organic material to produce steam, which turns turbines.</li>
                <li><strong>Heating:</strong> Biomass can be burned directly to heat buildings, or it can be converted into pellets or other forms for more efficient heating.</li>
                <li><strong>Biofuels:</strong> Biomass is used to create biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, which can be used in vehicles as a substitute for gasoline or diesel.</li>
            </ul>

                <div><p style="font-size: 20px;">As technology advances, biomass energy has the potential to become a significant contributor to the global energy mix.
                    Improved efficiency in conversion processes and sustainable resource management could reduce costs and environmental impacts,
                    making biomass a more competitive and environmentally-friendly energy source.</p></div>
