            <h2>Disadvantages of Solar Energy</h2>
            <img src="https://en.tongwei.com.cn/uploads/20240402/1ffe2a315638e24645f534bfc9d49d10.jpg" alt="Disadvantages of solar energy" class="image">
            <p>While solar energy is beneficial, it does have some drawbacks:</p>
            <ul class="disadvantages-list">
                <li><strong>High Initial Costs:</strong> The installation of solar panels and systems can be expensive, which may deter some from adopting this technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Dependent:</strong> Solar energy production depends on sunlight, meaning less energy is generated during cloudy days or at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Requirements:</strong> Solar panels require a lot of space to install, especially for large-scale energy production, which can be challenging in urban areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Storage is Expensive:</strong> Storing solar energy for use at night requires batteries, which add to the overall cost and have a limited lifespan.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Solar energy is an essential tool in the fight against climate change, offering a clean, renewable source of power. By adopting solar energy, we can move towards a more sustainable future, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and build a healthier planet. Additionally, solar energy promotes economic growth by creating jobs, enhancing energy security, and supporting local communities through reduced energy costs and increased investments. However, considerations like cost and weather dependency must also be accounted for.</p>
